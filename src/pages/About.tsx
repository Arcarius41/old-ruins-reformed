      <h1>About The Old Ruins Reformed</h1>

      <p style={{ maxWidth: 750, opacity: 0.85, marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        The Old Ruins Reformed exists to help Christians recover the depth,
        beauty, and faithfulness of the Reformed Christian tradition in a
        world that often prefers novelty over truth.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p style={{ maxWidth: 750, lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        Reclaiming a robust, Reformed heritage for the glory of God and the
        strength of His Church.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "2.5rem" }}>Our Mission</h2>
      <p style={{ maxWidth: 750, lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        The Old Ruins Reformed exists to serve the people of God by providing
        resources that are rooted in the Reformed tradition, so that we might
        be equipped not only to reclaim a sturdier version of Christianity,
        but also to love and obey God faithfully in the process.
      </p>

      <p style={{ maxWidth: 750, lineHeight: 1.7, marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
        If you share this desire, we invite you to walk with us as we seek to
        reclaim a Reformed heritage for the glory of God and the good of His
        people.
